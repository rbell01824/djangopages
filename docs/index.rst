Welcome to DjangoPages's documentation!
=======================================

**DjangoPages** provides a set of technologies to quickly and easily create rich DB driven responsive
web pages using

* Bootstrap 3
* jQuery
* Chartkick/Highcharts
* rfu

Unlike traditional templates, DjangoPages uses a declarative style of page creation.  Just as Django's
declarative ORM makes creating databases easier, DjangoPages provides a declarative style for page
content creation and layout.
