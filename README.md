# Overview

## Dry Technical Overview

**DjangoPages** provides a set of facilities that allow technically proficient users to

* create web pages with either a WYSIWYG editor, markdown, or reStructuredText,
* includes various charts, tables, forms, etc. in those pages
* populate the charts, tables, etc with
    * data based on Django/python code snippets and form inputs
    * arbitrary Python code

## Overall Concept

The fundamental notion is that reasonably technically proficient user can quickly and easily create
rich web pages with charts, graphs, tables, and forms driven by Django tables and arbitrary
python code.

By 'technically proficient' I mean that the user doesn't need to be a Django/Python guru but does need
to be comfortable with basic Django/Python concepts and techniques.  To create a basic web page with a
graph based on a Django table the user need only do something like this:

```
**Example graphpage here
```

Besides graphs **DjangoPages** contains a rich feature set that allows users to

* create 'smart' data tables based on Django/Python data
* export graph and table data via csv files
* export graph/chart images
* include markdown or html text on the page
* use forms & filters to customize the page and make it interactive
* create sophisticated bootstrap3 layouts
